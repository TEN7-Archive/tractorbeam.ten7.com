# Quickstart Examples


## Local files to a remote server over SSH

### Requirements

1. You need docker installed
2. You need an S3 style storage account -- in this example, we're using Digital Ocean 
3. You need to generate an access key set to use your storage provider's API to run the sync
4. You need to know the absolute path to the local files to back up
5. You need to know the absolute path to the configuration directory for the back-ups you're running

### Configuration

For this example, let's say you are building out your Tractor Beam back-ups in `/home/ten7/config`.

In that config directory you *need* a `tractorbeam` directory containing `tractorbeam.yml`

```
/home
  /ten7
    /config
      /tractorbeam
        tractorbeam.yml
      /keys
        access.txt
        secret.txt
```

It's best to keep your API keys out of any code which could be committed to a repository. So here we have them in a `keys` subdirectory.

### tractorbeam.yml

Your configuration file for Tractor Beam should look like this:

```yaml
tractorbeam:
  backupSets:
    daily: {}
    weekly: {}
    monthly: {}
  local:
    - path: "/backups"
      provider: "Digitalocean"
      bucket: "my_project"
      prefix: "my_project_backups/files"
      accessKeyFile: "/config/keys/access.txt"
      secretKey: "/config/keys/secret.txt"
      endpoint: "https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com"
      region: "nyc3"
      disabled: false
      backupSets:
        - "daily"
        - "weekly"
        - "monthly"
```

Let's go over the parts of this file

- backupSets are required even if you're doing super simple back-ups so you can start with empty sets to start
- in the `local` block we define the path to the backups as `/backup` by default
- `provider` is the S3 compatible cloud provide you're using; we're using Digital Ocean for this example
- `bucket` is the name of the storage you've set up in the cloud provider; we have Digital Ocean Spaces named `my_project`
- `prefix` is the path in the storage that will be used for this back-up
- `accessKeyFile` is the first part of the api key you generated
- `secretKeyFile` is the second part of the api key you generated
- Note: a personal access token usually isn't what you want, you want a storage api key
- `endpoint` is where your storage is located with the cloud provider; we've put our Digital Ocean end point address
- `region` is an optional parameter including helps
- `disabled: false` is optional but is great to set up so if you ever have to quickly disable it's already set up
- `backupSets` specifies which types of backup sets this can be included in 

### Command to run

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v /local/path/to/project:/backups \
  -v /local/path/to/config:/config \
  ten7/tractorbeam tractorbeam daily
```

Command breakdown:

- `docker run --rm` <br> this will run the container once and destroy the container (not your files) when it's done
- `-v` <br> this is asking docker to mount the directory before colon inside the container as the path defined after the colon
- `/local/path/to/project` <br> the complete path of the local directory to back-up which gets mounted in the container as /backups
    - this is recursive by default and will sync whatever is in this directory
- `/local/path/to/config` <br> the directory with the config files for the back-up process which gets mounted in the container as /config
- `ten7/tractorbeam` <br> the name of the image on Docker Hub that will be used to build the container
- `tractorbeam daily` <br> calls the tactorbeam script and asks it to run the daily backup, or whichever backup set you want
