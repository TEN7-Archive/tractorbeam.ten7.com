# Quickstart Examples


## Local files to a remote server over SSH

### Requirements

1. You need docker installed
2. You need an S3 style storage account -- in this example, we're using Digital Ocean 
3. You need to generate an access key set to use your storage provider's API to run the sync
4. You need to know the absolute path to the local files to back up
5. You need to know the absolute path to the configuration directory for the back-ups you're running

### Configuration

For this example, let's say you are building out your Tractor Beam back-ups in `/home/ten7/config`.

In that config directory you *need* a `tractorbeam` directory containing `tractorbeam.yml`

```
/home
  /ten7
    /config
      /tractorbeam
        tractorbeam.yml
      /keys
        access.txt
        secret.txt
```

It's best to keep your API keys out of any code which could be committed to a repository. So here we have them in a `keys` subdirectory.

### tractorbeam.yml

```yaml

```

### Command to run

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v /local/path/to/project:/backups \
  -v /local/path/to/config:/config \
  ten7/tractorbeam tractorbeam daily
```

Command breakdown:

- `docker run --rm` <br> this will run the container once and destroy the container (not your files) when it's done
- `-v` <br> this is asking docker to mount the directory before colon inside the container as the path defined after the colon
- `/local/path/to/project` <br> the complete path of the local directory to back-up which gets mounted in the container as /backups
    - this is recursive by default and will sync whatever is in this directory
- `/local/path/to/config` <br> the directory with the config files for the back-up process which gets mounted in the container as /config
- `ten7/tractorbeam` <br> the name of the image on Docker Hub that will be used to build the container
- `tractorbeam daily` <br> calls the tactorbeam script and asks it to run the daily backup, or whichever backup set you want
